# push-v5
In this project, I'll be sorting data on a stack using a limited set of instructions. My goal is to use the fewest number of actions possible. To succeed, I'll need to manipulate various types of algorithms and carefully choose the most appropriate solution from many options to achieve optimized data sorting.

First I push everyting to stack_b according to the chunks belonging.

The issue occurs when I push back to stack_a.      
The smallest combination I found that replicates the issue is:      
5 14 13 4 15 1 12 10 11 8 2 9 6 7 3
